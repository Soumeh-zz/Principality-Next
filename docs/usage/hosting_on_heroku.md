# Creating a Git Repository

Run the following commands:

`git init`
- Creates the git repository itself, used to easily share projects, in this case, your Principality Bot.

`git add .`
- Prepare files to be added to the repository.

`git commit -m "init"`
- Finally add the files to the repository.
